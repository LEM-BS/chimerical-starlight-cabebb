## Sitemap Updates
- Regenerated `public/sitemap.xml` so every location entry now matches the live `/town` URL instead of redirecting `-damp-surveys` variants.
- Confirmed Chester City Centre, Mollington, Queen's Park, and Upton appear in the sitemap.
- Verified blog and service URLs remain, including `/independent-damp-surveys` and `/importance-of-independent-damp-surveys` because they are valid live guides.

## Title Length Fixes
- Location pages now pass concise titles (e.g. `"Town Surveyors | LEM Building Surveying"`).
- `LocationPageTemplate.astro` enforces a 60-character cap and shortens branding automatically when required.

## Internal Linking Improvements
- `src/pages/about.astro` now includes extra contextual links to the damp survey hub, testimonials, and area directory.
- Service content in `src/content/services/*.mdx` links across to relevant Astro pages (RICS survey guide, ventilation assessments, EPC floorplans).

## Anchor Text Refresh
- Blog index "Read more" links replaced with descriptive phrases for every article card.

## llms.txt
- Confirmed `public/llms.txt` follows:
  ```
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: /private/
  Allow: /
  ```

## Redirect & Link Hygiene
- Updated canonical paths and internal links to use final `/town` slugs, eliminating redirect hops from internal navigation and sitemap entries.
- Legacy redirects in `public/_redirects` still accept the older `-damp-surveys` paths but no longer appear in internal links.

## Broken Link / Crawl Notes
- Local link targets were reviewed after the slug updates; `npm run sitemap` rebuild succeeded, indicating matching source files. Full external crawl still recommended post-deploy.

## Performance
- Astro/Vite minification remains enabled via `astro.config.mjs` (terser + lightningcss). No additional asset compression required at this stage.

## Next Steps / QA
- After deployment, rerun the crawl (Screaming Frog/Ahrefs) to verify:
  - ✅ No incorrect pages in `sitemap.xml`.
  - ✅ No internal 4xx links.
  - ✅ No redirect chains from internal links or sitemap URLs.
  - ✅ Titles stay within recommended length.
  - ✅ Anchor text remains descriptive.
  - ✅ Internal link depth improved on key service pages.
