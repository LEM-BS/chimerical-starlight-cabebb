## Independent guidance on RICS survey levels

Every property presents different risks. We start by learning about the age, construction and planned use of your
home so we can recommend the most suitable RICS Home Survey. Whether you are purchasing a modern estate property or
reviewing a period renovation, the inspection focuses on the issues that matter for negotiations and future upkeep.

### Survey levels delivered by LEM

- **Level 1 — Condition Report:** A concise traffic-light assessment for newer, well-maintained homes when you need formal documentation without extensive commentary.
- **Level 2 — HomeBuyer Survey:** A balanced report including advice on repairs, budget planning and legal considerations for conventional properties.
- **Level 3 — Building Survey:** A fully detailed investigation for older, extended or non-standard homes, complete with guidance on remedial options and priorities.

## A clear process from enquiry to report

1. Share your property details and objectives so we can confirm pricing and availability within the same working day.
2. We arrange access with agents or vendors, complete the site inspection and photograph key elements for reference.
3. Your digital report arrives promptly, followed by a call to explain findings, next steps and any referrals you may need.
