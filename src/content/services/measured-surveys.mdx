## Precise as-built data for confident design

Every project starts with reliable dimensions. Our measured building surveys capture floor levels, structural walls,
openings and key features so architects, contractors and homeowners can plan alterations without guesswork. We record
information on site using laser measurement and digital capture to ensure drawings align perfectly with the property.

### Survey outputs available

- **2D floorplans and reflected ceiling plans:** Clear drawings for redesigning interiors, planning extensions or submitting building control packages.
- **Elevations, sections and roof plans:** External and internal views mapped with datum levels, construction notes and materials for planners and heritage specialists.
- **Site and boundary plans:** Accurate plots that support title checks, landscaping schemes and contractor briefings.

## When a measured survey helps most

- **Refurbishment and conversions:** Provide designers with verified as-built information before structural alterations begin.
- **Listed or complex properties:** Capture irregular layouts, varying floor levels and period features so conservation work stays faithful to the original fabric.
- **Portfolio and compliance records:** Landlords and managing agents gain a dependable set of plans for maintenance programmes and fire safety documentation.
