      <strong>Damp and mould</strong> are some of the most common — and concerning —
      issues flagged during property surveys. If left untreated, they can cause
      structural damage, pose health risks, and lead to costly repairs. As a
      homebuyer or homeowner in North Wales or Cheshire, understanding how to spot the
      signs, what causes damp, and how to deal with it is essential.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is Damp?</h2>
    <p>
      "Damp" refers to excess moisture within a building. This can come from water
      ingress, poor ventilation, rising ground moisture, or even lifestyle factors
      (like drying clothes indoors). There are <strong>three main types</strong> of
      damp:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Rising Damp</strong> – Moisture travelling up through walls from the
        ground, usually due to a failed damp-proof course.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Penetrating Damp</strong> – Rain or moisture seeping through walls,
        roofs, or windows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Condensation Damp</strong> – Caused by everyday activities creating
        moisture that can't escape.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Is Mould a Problem?</h2>
    <p>
      Persistent damp often leads to <strong>mould growth</strong>, which can harm air
      quality and health — especially for children or the elderly. Mould signals deeper
      structural or ventilation issues that may lower a property's value.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Signs of Damp and Mould</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Musty smell in corners or cupboards</li>
      <li>Dark patches on walls or ceilings</li>
      <li>Peeling wallpaper or bubbling paint</li>
      <li>Black mould near windows or bathrooms</li>
      <li>Discoloured skirting boards or floors</li>
      <li>Walls that feel damp or cold</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can a Building Survey Identify Damp?</h2>
    <p>
      Absolutely. A <strong>RICS Level 2 or Level 3 survey</strong> can identify damp and
      mould issues — even hidden ones. At LEM Building Surveying, we use
      <strong>moisture meters, thermal imaging</strong>, and our <strong>local
      knowledge</strong> to assess cause and severity, helping you make informed
      decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>What Can Be Done About It?</h2>
    <p>Solutions depend on the cause:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Improve ventilation, use extractor fans.</li>
      <li><strong>Penetrating damp:</strong> Repair external faults like leaks or cracks.</li>
      <li><strong>Rising damp:</strong> May require a new damp-proof course.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In all cases, prevention is cheaper than cure — and acting early is crucial.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Insight</h2>
    <p>
      In areas like <strong>Chester and Flintshire</strong>, older terraces often suffer
      rising damp due to aged DPCs. In <strong>Wrexham</strong>, we see condensation damp
      in 1950s homes due to poor ventilation. Our local expertise allows us to recommend
      realistic, area-specific solutions.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Damp and mould can seriously affect property health and value. If you're buying or
      selling and want peace of mind, a professional survey is essential.
