    <p><strong>Damp and mould</strong> are common — and serious — issues flagged during property surveys. Left untreated, they can damage fabric, affect health, and lead to costly repairs. Here’s how to recognise problems, understand causes, and pick the right fixes.</p>

    <h2>What Is “Damp”?</h2>
    <p>Excess moisture within a building, typically from water ingress, ventilation/thermal issues, or local defects. The main patterns we encounter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Condensation</strong> — indoor moisture condenses on cold surfaces (often winter-biased; external corners; behind furniture; window reveals).</li>
      <li><strong>Penetrating damp</strong> — rainwater through defects (pointing/render/flashings/gutters/seals; cavity insulation bridging), typically worse after rain.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-level moisture / capillary rise (uncommon)</strong> — frequently a <em>symptom</em> of bridging or altered fabric. Diagnose true capillary rise only after evidence-led investigation and, where justified, BRE Digest 245 gravimetric testing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Mould Matters</h2>
    <p>Persistent damp can lead to mould growth, degraded indoor air quality, and health risks — especially for children, older adults, and those with respiratory conditions.</p>

    <h2>Typical Signs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Musty odours; black mould to corners/reveals</li>
      <li>Dark patches, peeling/bubbling paint or wallpaper</li>
      <li>Salt banding or tide marks at low level</li>
      <li>Cold-to-touch or visibly damp walls/skirtings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Surveys Identify Damp</h2>
    <p>We combine visual/thermal inspection, context review, and measurements. Electrical meters are <em>screening tools</em> only. Where capillary rise is suspected, we confirm by <strong>BRE Digest 245</strong> (gravimetric) methods — not guesswork.</p>

    <h2>Fixes That Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> Commission/repair extract fans; ensure background air inlets; address cold surfaces/thermal bridges.</li>
      <li><strong>Penetrating damp:</strong> Repair the envelope: gutters/downpipes, flashings, pointing/render, seals; check cavity insulation for bridging.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-level moisture:</strong> Remove bridging first (lower external ground, clear cavities, cut back bridging plaster/render). Consider any DPC only if testing proves true capillary rise and no effective DPC exists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Insight</h2>
    <p>Older terraces in <strong>Chester</strong> and <strong>Flintshire</strong> often show low-level moisture due to bridging and aged/altered fabric. In <strong>Wrexham</strong>, we frequently see condensation issues in loft conversions and 1950s semis where ventilation/insulation are sub-optimal.</p>
