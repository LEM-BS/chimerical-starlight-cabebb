      Moisture problems cost money, damage buildings, and harm health; they don't go
      away on their own. This guide explains the real causes of damp and mould, how
      to diagnose them properly, what effective remedial works look like, and where
      the law now stands.
    </p>
    <h2>Why Damp and Mould Matter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Health:</strong> Increases risk of respiratory illness, especially for
        vulnerable people. Official guidance now classifies damp as a health issue,
        not a housekeeping failure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Housing standards:</strong> HHSRS identifies damp/mould as hazards; the
        Homes Act 2018 empowers tenants to act against landlords for unfit
        conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Culture shift:</strong> Guidance says don't blame residents for
        "lifestyle". Landlords must investigate and fix causes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5 Common Causes of Damp</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Condensation:</strong> Appears as black mould on corners, behind
        furniture, and north-facing rooms. Root causes: cold surfaces, poor
        ventilation, intermittent heat. Managed per BS 5250:2021.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Penetrating Damp:</strong> Caused by rain via defects — pointing,
        render, gutters, seals. Worsens after rain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rising Damp:</strong> Capillary moisture from ground. Often
        misdiagnosed. Confirm only with BRE Digest 245 (gravimetric sampling).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leaks:</strong> Intermittent or hidden. Staining, salts, patterns help
        identify.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Subfloor Moisture:</strong> Blocked vents, high external ground levels,
        missing membranes allow moisture ingress.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How a Competent Survey Diagnoses Damp</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow BS 5250:2021 risk principles</li>
      <li>Inspect fabric, rainwater goods, junctions, ventilation</li>
      <li>Use hygrothermal logging + RH checks</li>
      <li>Moisture meters for screening only — confirm via gravimetric BRE 245</li>
      <li>Salt analysis for source type (chlorides, nitrates, sulphates)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> Chemical DPCs prescribed from a few meter pokes are
      unprofessional. BRE 245 warns against this.
    </p>

    <h2>Fixes That Work</h2>
    <h3>Condensation and Surface Mould</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Insulate cold surfaces (liners, IBR)</li>
      <li>Ventilate consistently (extracts, trickle vents, background inlets)</li>
      <li>Reduce moisture at source (cooking, bathing, drying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Penetrating Damp</h3>
    <p>Repair defects in gutters, walls, seals; check cavity insulation bridging.</p>

    <h3>Rising Damp</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove bridging</li>
      <li>Lower ground levels, unblock cavities</li>
      <li>Only insert DPC if no functioning one exists and diagnosis confirmed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Leaks / Subfloor Moisture</h3>
    <p>Fix source; dry and inspect. Reinstate membranes or vents as needed.</p>

    <h3>Mould Removal</h3>
    <p>
      Treat cause first. Wash hard surfaces; remove/replace soft materials if
      contaminated. Follow government safety advice.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal Duties (England)</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Now:</strong> Landlords must maintain habitable homes. Damp/mould can
      render them unfit. Local councils can enforce under HHSRS. Tenants can act via
      Homes Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>From Oct 27, 2025 (Awaab's Law):</strong> Registered social landlords
      must act on serious hazards, starting with damp and mould, within fixed
      timeframes. Further rollout planned.
    </p>
    <p><em>Always check the latest GOV.UK guidance for legal decisions.</em></p>

    <h2>Common Myths</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>"It's just condensation":</strong> Often not — other mechanisms
        coexist. Diagnose first.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"Meter = rising damp":</strong> Electrical meters are not proof.
        Gravimetric sampling required.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>"Bleach fixes it":</strong> Bleach discolours, but doesn't treat
        porous materials or cause.
      </li>
    </ul>
