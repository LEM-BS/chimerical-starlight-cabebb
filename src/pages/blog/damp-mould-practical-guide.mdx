    <p>Moisture problems cost money, damage buildings, and harm health; they don’t go away on their own. This article explains the <strong>real causes</strong> of damp and mould, <strong>how to diagnose them properly</strong>, <strong>what effective remedial works look like</strong>, and <strong>where the law now stands</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Why damp and mould matter</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Health:</strong> Damp and mould increase risks of respiratory infections and asthma; children, older adults, and people with existing conditions are more vulnerable. Treat damp and mould as a <strong>health risk</strong>, not a housekeeping issue.</li>
      <li><strong>Housing standards:</strong> Damp and mould are hazards under HHSRS; the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018 lets tenants take action if a dwelling is unfit, including because of damp and mould.</li>
      <li><strong>Culture change:</strong> Official guidance stresses residents should not be blamed; cooking, bathing and drying clothes are normal. Landlords must investigate and fix causes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The five common causes (and how they look)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Condensation</strong> — moisture from indoor air condenses on cold surfaces.<br/>Clues: black mould on external corners, window reveals, behind furniture, north-facing rooms, winter bias. Root causes: low surface temperatures, inadequate ventilation or intermittent heating. Managed per <strong>BS 5250:2021</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Penetrating damp</strong> — rainwater through defects: failed pointing, cracked render, porous masonry, defective flashings, blocked/leaking gutters, failed seals, or cavity-wall insulation bridging. Typically localised patches that worsen after rain.</li>
      <li><strong>Low-level moisture / capillary rise (uncommon)</strong> — often a <em>symptom</em> of bridging or altered fabric. Electrical moisture meters are qualitative; <em>not proof</em>. Confirm true capillary rise only with <strong>BRE Digest 245</strong> (gravimetric) and salts/context.</li>
      <li><strong>Leaks</strong> — plumbing, wastes, overflows, shower enclosures, flat roofs. Often intermittent/hidden; salts and staining patterns help differentiate.</li>
      <li><strong>Sub-floor/ground moisture</strong> — high external ground levels, blocked sub-floor vents, or missing membranes allow moisture to bypass defences.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How a competent survey should diagnose damp</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context & fabric review:</strong> age, construction, alterations, ventilation strategy, heating patterns, thermal bridges (apply BS 5250:2021 principles).</li>
      <li><strong>Visual & thermal inspection:</strong> map patterns; check rainwater goods, penetrations, junctions, and cold spots.</li>
      <li><strong>Hygrothermal measurements:</strong> spot/logged temperature & RH; check ventilation flow-rates where relevant.</li>
      <li><strong>Moisture profiling:</strong> use electrical meters for screening only; confirm suspected capillary rise with <strong>BRE 245 gravimetric sampling</strong> (hygroscopic vs capillary moisture).</li>
      <li><strong>Salt analysis:</strong> chlorides/nitrates suggest ground salts; sulphates can indicate other sources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Red flag:</strong> anyone prescribing chemical DPCs from a few meter pokes is guessing, not surveying — exactly what BRE 245 warns against.</p>

    <h2>Fixes that actually work</h2>
    <h3>Condensation & surface mould</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase surface temperatures: insulate cold spots (liners/IBR systems); address thermal bridges.</li>
      <li>Ventilate consistently: repair/commission extract fans; consider continuous/trickle extract; ensure background inlets; commission systems properly.</li>
      <li>Control moisture at source: lids on pans; extract during/after bathing; avoid drying clothes indoors where possible, or provide ventilated drying spaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Penetrating damp</h3>
    <p>Repair the envelope: gutters, downpipes, flashings, pointing, sealant; check cavities/insulation for bridging and remove localised slumps where needed.</p>

    <h3>Low-level moisture / capillary rise (only where confirmed)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Remove bridging: reduce ground levels; clear blocked cavities; cut back plaster/render bridging the DPC line.</li>
      <li>Only then consider DPC insertion (physical preferred; chemical where appropriate) if testing demonstrates true capillary rise and no effective DPC exists; renew contaminated plaster with an appropriate specification.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Leaks & sub-floor moisture</h3>
    <p>Fix the leak first; ventilate and dry; inspect concealed voids; reinstate membranes or ventilation.</p>

    <h3>Treating mould safely</h3>
    <p>Tackle the <em>cause</em> first; then clean. Non-porous surfaces can be washed; soft furnishings and mould-contaminated plaster may need replacing. Prioritise prompt action to reduce exposure.</p>

    <h2>Legal duties (England) — where things stand today</h2>
    <p><strong>Now:</strong> Landlords must keep homes fit for human habitation; damp and mould can render a property unfit. Tenants can act under the Homes Act 2018. Local authorities assess hazards under HHSRS and can enforce. Guidance instructs landlords to investigate and fix; don’t blame “lifestyle”.</p>
    <p><strong>From 27 October 2025 (Awaab’s Law, phase 1 – social housing):</strong> Prescribed timescales for investigating and repairing serious hazards — starting with damp and mould — will apply to registered providers of social housing. The rollout is phased; always check the latest GOV.UK guidance.</p>
    <p><em>Policy evolves: verify current guidance before taking legal decisions.</em></p>

    <h2>Quick myth-busting</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“It’s just condensation.”</strong> Sometimes — but penetration, leaks, bridging and ground moisture are common; mechanisms can coexist. Diagnose before prescribing.</li>
      <li><strong>“A meter says it’s rising damp.”</strong> Electrical meters are qualitative; you need <strong>BRE 245</strong> gravimetric proof.</li>
      <li><strong>“Bleach fixes mould.”</strong> It can discolour on hard surfaces but won’t fix porous materials or the underlying moisture problem. Remove the cause and reduce exposure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What we do on a damp & mould survey</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Evidence-based diagnosis to BS 5250:2021 principles</li>
      <li>Moisture mapping and targeted BRE-245 sampling where justified</li>
      <li>Action plan prioritising defect repairs, ventilation commissioning, and realistic behaviour guidance that doesn’t shift blame</li>
      <li>Clear scope of works for contractors; re-inspection as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to call us</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Recurrent mould despite cleaning</li>
      <li>Damp patches that worsen after rain</li>
      <li>Tide-marks/salt banding at low level</li>
      <li>Musty odours, peeling finishes, or deteriorating plaster</li>
      <li>Condensation problems after window replacements or insulation works</li>
    </ul>
