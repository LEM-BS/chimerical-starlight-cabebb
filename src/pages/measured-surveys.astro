      <h2>When to Commission a Measured Survey</h2>
      <p>
        A measured survey gives you a dependable baseline before building work begins.
        It is particularly useful when you are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Planning an extension, loft conversion or remodelling project.</li>
        <li>Preparing documentation for lease plans or change-of-use applications.</li>
        <li>Reviewing the current layout to solve space, ventilation or damp issues.</li>
        <li>Recording the as-built condition before handing a property back to a landlord.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="box-container">
      <h2>Our Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Brief and quote:</strong> Share drawings required and any format preferences so we
          can tailor the deliverables.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-site measurement:</strong> Laser measurements and photographic references are
          captured methodically to ensure accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drawing production:</strong> Plans are drafted in CAD, checked for consistency and
          annotated with levels or notes agreed during the brief.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delivery and follow-up:</strong> Receive digital files plus an optional run-through
          to explain key points or discuss next steps with your design team.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Turnaround times vary depending on property size, but most residential surveys are
        delivered within five working days of the site visit.
