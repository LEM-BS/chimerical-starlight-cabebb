  'Vicars Cross, just east of Chester city centre, is a classic post-war suburb: rows of 1950s-1970s semi-detached houses, bungalows, and more recent infill. Many homes have been extended or remodelled—open-plan kitchens, garage conversions and lofts are common—meaning buyers must pay close attention to the quality and compliance of past works. Typical issues include poor insulation, flat roof leaks, incomplete paperwork for extensions, and patchy upgrades to windows and electrics.',
  'Damp, condensation and ventilation problems crop up where older construction meets new materials. We routinely find original cavity walls that have been filled poorly, leading to bridging and cold spots. With large gardens and mature planting, tree roots can affect drains and foundations.',
  'Our surveys are clear and practical: highlighting risks, urgent repairs, and what matters for ongoing maintenance. You get advice rooted in local reality—useful for buyers, renovators, and families upgrading their home.',

Flat roofs on garages and rear extensions can fail, and older electrics sometimes linger beneath newer cosmetic finishes.

    'Boundary issues occasionally arise, as plots are generous and fences can migrate over the years. Large gardens also mean drains and soakaways are often home-made or in need of attention.',
