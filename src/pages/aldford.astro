  "Aldford is a carefully managed village on the Eaton Estate, combining sandstone estate cottages, elegant Georgian farmhouses and discreet modern infill. Properties are often Grade II listed or subject to estate covenants, so buyers must balance heritage expectations with practical maintenance. We help you understand how the fabric of these homes performs today and what it will take to care for them over the long term.",
  "Conversions of former agricultural buildings sit alongside brick-built family homes and executive houses on the edges of the village. Each construction type reacts differently to the River Dee’s high water table, local clay soils and historic drainage routes. Our inspections dig into these details—checking for settlement, damp bridging, insulation gaps and ventilation routes that affect comfort and running costs.",
  "Clients instructing us in Aldford range from families upsizing within rural Cheshire to investors buying estate-managed rentals. They value fast, direct access to an experienced surveyor who can translate site findings into clear actions, highlight negotiation points and point to the permissions needed for future works.",
