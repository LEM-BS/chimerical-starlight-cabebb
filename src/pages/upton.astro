  "Upton is a popular suburb just north of Chester city centre, known for its spacious detached and semi-detached homes, larger gardens, and access to schools and the zoo. Most properties date from the inter-war and post-war period, with pockets of modern estates and some earlier cottages near Upton Lane. Extensions, garage conversions and open-plan remodelling are very common—meaning buyers must be alert to the quality, compliance, and impact of past works.",
  "Common issues include movement or subsidence (particularly in older houses or those near former clay pits), cold bridging, flat roof leaks on extensions, and inconsistent insulation. Many Upton homes have seen kitchen extensions, conservatories or lofts; paperwork is not always complete, and standards can vary widely. We also see drainage changes and issues with garden walls or mature trees affecting the structure.",
  "Our surveys focus on identifying risks, prioritising urgent repairs, and offering straightforward advice about what’s necessary and what’s cosmetic. Reports are practical and jargon-free, designed for buyers, movers and families upgrading their space.",
  'Need clarity on which survey fits local properties? Explore our <a href="/level-2">RICS Level 2 Home Survey</a>, see when a <a href="/level-3">Level 3 Building Survey</a> is the best option, and request targeted <a href="/damp-timber-surveys">Timber and Damp Investigation, Damp Survey or Damp and Mould Survey services</a> if moisture is a concern.',
