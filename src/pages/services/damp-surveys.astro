      <h2>Why book a damp survey?</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you’re buying a home or dealing with persistent mould, an
        evidence-led survey gets to the root cause — not just the symptoms.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Condensation</strong> — ventilation, insulation and thermal-bridge
          related issues
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Penetrating damp</strong> — envelope defects and cavity insulation
          bridging
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Low-level moisture</strong> — we treat “rising damp” claims with
          caution; we investigate bridging/alterations first and confirm capillary
          rise via BRE 245 only where justified
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What’s included</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Moisture pattern mapping &amp; meter screening</li>
        <li>Thermal imaging (where justified)</li>
        <li>
          Hygrothermal checks; ventilation assessment &amp; commissioning advice
        </li>
        <li>
          Clear, prioritised action plan (defect repairs before treatments)
        </li>
        <li>Optional follow-up with the surveyor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We tailor our approach by building age and type — from Victorian
        terraces in Chester to 1950s semis in Wrexham.
