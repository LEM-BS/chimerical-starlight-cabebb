      <h2>Why Get a Damp Survey?</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're buying a home or spotting suspicious patches in your current
        property, a professional damp survey can reveal hidden moisture issues before
        they cause serious damage. Our <strong>RICS-accredited surveys</strong>
        identify:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rising Damp</strong> – Often due to failed or missing damp-proof courses</li>
        <li><strong>Penetrating Damp</strong> – Leaks through walls, roofs, or windows</li>
        <li><strong>Condensation</strong> – Typically from poor ventilation or insulation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What's Included in Our Survey</h2>
      <p>Our damp inspections include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moisture meter readings</li>
        <li>Thermal imaging (if needed)</li>
        <li>Ventilation assessment</li>
        <li>Written report with recommendations</li>
        <li>Optional follow-up advice with our surveyor</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We tailor our approach based on building type and age – from Victorian terraces
        in Chester to 1950s semis in Wrexham.
