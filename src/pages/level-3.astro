      <h2>Is a Level 3 Survey Right for You?</h2>
      <p>
        This is the most detailed inspection permitted under the
        <strong>RICS Home Survey Standard</strong>. Choose it for period homes,
        buildings with obvious defects, or properties you plan to renovate
        extensively. We often inspect Georgian terraces, Victorian villas,
        farmhouses and unique self-builds where construction methods vary from
        room to room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Level 3 format gives you a forensic understanding of what is really
        happening behind the plaster. It explains the cause of defects, the risk
        if they are left unresolved, and the most practical route to repair so
        you can budget with confidence.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-1945 homes or listed buildings</li>
        <li>Properties in poor or unclear condition</li>
        <li>Buildings that have been heavily altered or extended</li>
        <li>Buyers planning major renovations or conversions</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What’s Included in the Survey</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Roof space, sub-floor voids, walls, chimneys, and drainage (where
          accessible)
        </li>
        <li>Assessment of structure, materials, and safety risks</li>
        <li>Repair recommendations and (if agreed) budget estimates</li>
        <li>Optional extras: thermal imaging, damp-mapping, contractor briefings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Note: Optional services are quoted separately for full cost
          transparency.</em>
      </p>
      <h2>How We Investigate on Site</h2>
      <p>
        Allow half a day for the inspection of a typical four-bedroom home. We
        take timber moisture readings, map damp patches, and document hidden
        junctions with borescope cameras where permission is granted. Structural
        movement is monitored using laser levels and crack measurers, allowing us
        to comment on whether distortion is historic or active.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every accessible void is checked for ventilation, rot and infestations.
        Services such as electrics and plumbing are visually reviewed so you know
        when to commission specialists. Where information is missing—such as
        blocked off fireplaces or sealed cellars—we make clear recommendations
        for further opening up.
      </p>
      <h2>What the Report Delivers</h2>
      <p>
        You receive a narrative report with annotated photography, priority
        ratings and suggested repair strategies. If you ask for budget costings
        we include realistic local figures or ranges to aid negotiations. The
        report also highlights legal queries for your solicitor, such as missing
        completion certificates or unauthorised alterations.
      </p>
      <p>
        After delivery we schedule a follow-up call to answer questions and help
        you plan the next steps. Clients often use this session to discuss
        contractor sequencing, timescales and temporary repairs if works need to
        be phased.
      </p>
      <h2>Typical Issues Uncovered</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Structural movement in sandstone or shallow foundations</li>
        <li>Penetrating damp, wet/dry rot, or timber decay</li>
        <li>Unsafe alterations or lack of building regs compliance</li>
        <li>Inefficient solid-wall insulation or ventilation problems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>
        <em>The questions below cover the practicalities of commissioning a
          Level 3 survey with LEM.</em>
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Who needs a Level 3 Building Survey?</summary>
        <p>
          Commission a Level 3 survey if the property is older, has experienced
          movement or moisture problems, or has been altered in ways you do not
          fully understand. The additional detail helps you plan major repairs
          and protects against unpleasant surprises after completion.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What extra detail does a Level 3 survey provide?</summary>
        <p>
          Unlike a Level 2 report, the Level 3 narrative sets out defect causes,
          likely outcomes and bespoke repair options. It may also include budget
          ranges and maintenance schedules so you can brief contractors and
          prioritise work realistically.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you access lofts and sub-floor voids?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Where it is safe and accessible we enter roof spaces, cellars and
          voids to inspect timbers, insulation and ventilation. If access is
          restricted we explain why and recommend further opening up if
          necessary.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can you include repair budgets or contractor recommendations?</summary>
        <p>
          Indicative repair budgets and scopes of work are available for an
          agreed fee. While we stay independent and do not endorse specific
          contractors, we advise which trades to approach and the questions to
          ask before instructing them.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How long does the survey and report take?</summary>
        <p>
          Level 3 inspections typically take half a day on site, with the report
          delivered within five to seven working days. If something urgent is
          discovered you will receive a same-day summary call so you can act
          quickly.
