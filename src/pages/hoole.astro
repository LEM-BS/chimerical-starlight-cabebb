  "Hoole is Chester’s classic ‘urban village’—rows of Victorian and Edwardian terraces, converted period houses, and pockets of more modern homes near Faulkner Street and Alexandra Park. These popular streets bring character, walkability and community, but also unique survey issues: solid walls with little insulation, cellars prone to damp, and older roofs needing careful inspection. Many homes have seen extensions or loft conversions, so understanding the quality and compliance of past work is essential.",
  "Buyers in Hoole often encounter bridging in filled cavity walls, inconsistent repairs, and evidence of historic movement—especially near the railway or in homes with shallow foundations. We routinely inspect for hidden moisture, timber decay, and missing documentation for alterations. Our reports are focused on clarity, priorities, and helping you negotiate with confidence.",
  "Whether you’re buying your first terrace, trading up to a larger family home, or investing in a buy-to-let, we provide straightforward, practical advice and local market insight.",

    "Victorian and Edwardian terraces dominate Hoole’s streetscape, with many houses retaining original sash windows, high ceilings and fireplaces. However, these features often go hand-in-hand with uninsulated solid walls, shallow footings and cellars vulnerable to moisture. Modern cavity wall insulation can sometimes cause bridging or trap damp, and party wall issues are common during renovations.",
    "Roof structures may show signs of age or piecemeal repair. We always check for movement, past leaks, missing insulation and the condition of chimneys and flashings. Many properties have seen extensions, loft conversions or open-plan alterations—so we’re alert for compliance gaps and structural shortcuts.",
