  "Bretton sits on the edge of Chester, combining traditional cottages on the old Chester Road with 1960s bungalows, former local-authority homes and modern cul-de-sacs near Broughton Retail Park. Border proximity means Welsh and English planning rules can overlap, while busy commuter routes bring extra wear to driveways, garages and parking courts.",
  "Properties close to the Airbus campus often have extensions, loft conversions or sunrooms added over time to maximise space. We review how these additions interact with the original structure, the quality of past damp-proofing, and whether ventilation keeps pace with heavier use.",
