  <h2>Independent Surveyor for Farndon &amp; Holt</h2>
  <p>
          Based near Chester, we carry out RICS Home Surveys for buyers, sellers and homeowners in Farndon and surrounding areas. Whether it’s a modern home or a period property, we’ll give you practical insight — clearly explained and promptly delivered.
        </p>
  <h2>Home Survey Options</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Level 1 — Condition Report:</strong> Basic summary of condition, no advice — best for newer homes with no obvious defects.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 2 — HomeBuyer Survey:</strong> The most popular choice for standard homes — includes repair advice and maintenance tips.</li>
  <li><strong>Level 3 — Building Survey:</strong> Full structural inspection for older or extended homes — ideal for cottages, stone homes, or non-standard construction.</li>
  <li><strong>Damp &amp; Timber Reports:</strong> For targeted damp issues, rot or timber defects.</li>
  <li><strong>EPCs &amp; Floorplans:</strong> Useful for listings, compliance, or planning alterations.</li>
  </ul>
