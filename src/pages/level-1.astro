  <h2>What Is a Level 1 Survey?</h2>
  <p>The RICS Level 1 Condition Report is a simple, visual inspection of a property’s key features. It's designed to highlight urgent issues, legal concerns, or obvious red flags for modern properties in good condition—typically under 10 years old. This survey does not include repair advice or valuation, making it a cost-effective choice when risks are low.</p>
  <h2>What’s Covered (and What’s Not)</h2>
  <div class="table-scroll">
  <table class="comparison-table">
  <thead>
  <tr><th>Included</th><th>Excluded</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>Visual inspection of walls, roof, windows, services &amp; grounds</td>
  <td>Invasive tests or removal of floorboards, carpets, furniture</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Traffic-light ratings for condition</td>
  <td>Detailed repair schedule or cost estimates</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>Identification of obvious damp, movement, infestations</td>
  <td>Market valuation or insurance reinstatement figure</td>

  </div>
  <p><strong>Why choose this:</strong> It reassures lenders, flags urgent issues, and helps you decide whether a deeper survey is needed—without the added cost.</p>
  <h2>Common Buyer Questions Answered</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>“Are there any visible signs of structural problems?”</li>

  <li>“Do I need a Level 2 or Level 3 instead?” — If so, we’ll advise accordingly.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Is This Survey Right for You?</h2>

  <ul>
  <li>First-time buyers wanting reassurance without overspending</li>
  <li>Buy-to-let investors purchasing newer flats or houses</li>
