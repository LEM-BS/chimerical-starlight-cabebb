  'Christleton combines classic Cheshire village appeal—listed cottages, handsome period homes, and modern family houses—with rivers, canals and rolling countryside on the doorstep. Flood risk, ground conditions and planning restrictions are all genuine factors for buyers here. Many homes are listed or in conservation areas, so even modest upgrades require careful planning and consent. Our surveys blend technical rigour with practical, local knowledge for buyers and owners in Christleton and nearby villages.',
  'Older houses may have historic movement, timber or roof issues, while newer estates can present snagging, settlement or incomplete landscaping. Many properties feature extensions, barn conversions or annexes—so compliance and build quality can vary widely. We’re alert for private drainage, tree and boundary risks, and realistic ongoing maintenance requirements.',
  'Our reports explain urgent priorities, highlight legal or planning constraints, and help you move forward with confidence—whether you’re moving to the village or upsizing within Christleton.',
  'Need clarity on which survey fits local properties?
