      <h2>Why Homeowners Choose Independent Damp Surveys</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Evidence-led diagnosis:</strong> Readings are logged, photographed
          and explained so you understand cause and effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No chemical bias:</strong> Recommendations focus on ventilation,
          drainage, insulation and maintenance before invasive treatments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support for negotiations:</strong> Ideal for buyers or tenants
          who need neutral documentation to request remedial work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance ready:</strong> Reports meet the expectations of lenders,
          managing agents and local authorities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Independent assessments are particularly valuable when damp has
        persisted despite previous contractor visits or when you suspect
        condensation, thermal bridging or lifestyle factors are the real
        drivers.
      </p>
      <h2>When a Contractor Inspection Might Be Appropriate</h2>
      <p>
        There are situations where bringing in a contractor early can work,
        especially for urgent repairs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Known maintenance failures:</strong> For example, a leaking gutter
          or cracked render already confirmed through visual inspection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simple patch repairs:</strong> When you need a quotation to replace
          a section of damp-proof course or re-point a wall.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Existing warranties:</strong> If previous works are under guarantee
          you may need the original installer to revisit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, even in these cases an independent report can help you verify
        the root cause before committing to major expenditure.
      </p>
      <h2>How Our Independent Damp Survey Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Briefing call:</strong> We review your concerns, property age,
          previous works and photographs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-site assessment:</strong> Using calibrated meters, thermo-hygrometers
          and thermal imaging where beneficial.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Root cause analysis:</strong> Findings are cross-referenced with
          building design, ventilation, heating and occupancy patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear reporting:</strong> You receive a digital report with moisture
          profiles, photographs and prioritised actions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Follow-up support:</strong> We walk you through the conclusions
          and answer questions for contractors or landlords.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Typical Costs &amp; Timescales</h2>
      <p>
        Independent damp surveys are a professional service that saves you money
        by preventing unnecessary treatments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Local surveys from £275 with no VAT to add:</strong> Pricing depends on property
          size, number of rooms assessed and travel distance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Report delivery within 3–5 working days:</strong> Urgent cases
          can often be fast-tracked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optional extras:</strong> Laboratory salt analysis or long-term
          humidity monitoring can be added if required.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Compare this with the cost of installing chemical DPC injections,
        replastering or whole-house ventilation systems that may not address the
        real cause.
      </p>
      <h2>Putting the Report into Action</h2>
      <p>After receiving your independent survey you will know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which building elements require repair, upgrade or monitoring.</li>
        <li>The order of priority and the estimated level of urgency.</li>
        <li>What information to give contractors when sourcing quotes.</li>
        <li>
          How to adapt ventilation and heating to keep moisture under control.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQs About Independent Damp Surveys</h2>
      <div class="faq-section">
        <details>
          <summary>Will you recommend specific products or installers?</summary>
          <p>
            Our role is to diagnose and advise. We remain independent, but can
            outline the type of specialist you may need and provide questions to
            ask before appointing them.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can you liaise with my landlord or contractor?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. With your permission we can discuss findings with third parties
            to ensure remedial actions follow best practice.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary
            >Do you investigate condensation as well as rising damp?</summary
          >
          <p>
            Absolutely. Condensation, ventilation failures and thermal bridges
            are among the most common issues we solve. We use humidity profiling
            and thermal imaging to separate these from true rising damp.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is disruptive testing ever required?</summary>
          <p>
            Most surveys are non-invasive. If opening up is necessary we will
            explain why, outline options and only proceed with your approval.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do you cover housing disrepair claims?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Independent damp evidence is frequently requested for
            disrepair, insurance and legal matters. Our reports include the
            level of detail required for these cases.
