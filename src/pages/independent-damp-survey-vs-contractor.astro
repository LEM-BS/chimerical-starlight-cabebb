      <h2>Why Homeowners Choose Independent Damp Surveys</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Evidence-led diagnosis:</strong> Readings are logged, photographed and explained so you understand cause and effect.</li>
        <li><strong>No chemical bias:</strong> Recommendations focus on ventilation, drainage, insulation and maintenance before invasive treatments.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for negotiations:</strong> Ideal for buyers or tenants who need neutral documentation to request remedial work.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance ready:</strong> Reports meet the expectations of lenders, managing agents and local authorities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Independent assessments are particularly valuable when damp has persisted despite previous contractor visits or when you suspect condensation, thermal bridging or lifestyle factors are the real drivers.</p>
      <h2>When a Contractor Inspection Might Be Appropriate</h2>
      <p>There are situations where bringing in a contractor early can work, especially for urgent repairs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Known maintenance failures:</strong> For example, a leaking gutter or cracked render already confirmed through visual inspection.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple patch repairs:</strong> When you need a quotation to replace a section of damp-proof course or re-point a wall.</li>
        <li><strong>Existing warranties:</strong> If previous works are under guarantee you may need the original installer to revisit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, even in these cases an independent report can help you verify the root cause before committing to major expenditure.</p>
      <h2>How Our Independent Damp Survey Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Briefing call:</strong> We review your concerns, property age, previous works and photographs.</li>
        <li><strong>On-site assessment:</strong> Using calibrated meters, thermo-hygrometers and thermal imaging where beneficial.</li>
        <li><strong>Root cause analysis:</strong> Findings are cross-referenced with building design, ventilation, heating and occupancy patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear reporting:</strong> You receive a digital report with moisture profiles, photographs and prioritised actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow-up support:</strong> We walk you through the conclusions and answer questions for contractors or landlords.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Typical Costs &amp; Timescales</h2>
      <p>Independent damp surveys are a professional service that saves you money by preventing unnecessary treatments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local surveys from £275+VAT:</strong> Pricing depends on property size, number of rooms assessed and travel distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Report delivery within 3–5 working days:</strong> Urgent cases can often be fast-tracked.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional extras:</strong> Laboratory salt analysis or long-term humidity monitoring can be added if required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Compare this with the cost of installing chemical DPC injections, replastering or whole-house ventilation systems that may not address the real cause.</p>
      <h2>Putting the Report into Action</h2>
      <p>After receiving your independent survey you will know:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which building elements require repair, upgrade or monitoring.</li>
        <li>The order of priority and the estimated level of urgency.</li>
        <li>What information to give contractors when sourcing quotes.</li>
        <li>How to adapt ventilation and heating to keep moisture under control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQs About Independent Damp Surveys</h2>
      <div class="faq-section">
        <details>
          <summary>Will you recommend specific products or installers?</summary>
          <p>Our role is to diagnose and advise. We remain independent, but can outline the type of specialist you may need and provide questions to ask before appointing them.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Can you liaise with my landlord or contractor?</summary>
          <p>Yes. With your permission we can discuss findings with third parties to ensure remedial actions follow best practice.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do you investigate condensation as well as rising damp?</summary>
          <p>Absolutely. Condensation, ventilation failures and thermal bridges are among the most common issues we solve. We use humidity profiling and thermal imaging to separate these from true rising damp.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Is disruptive testing ever required?</summary>
          <p>Most surveys are non-invasive. If opening up is necessary we will explain why, outline options and only proceed with your approval.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Do you cover housing disrepair claims?</summary>
          <p>Yes. Independent damp evidence is frequently requested for disrepair, insurance and legal matters. Our reports include the level of detail required for these cases.</p>
