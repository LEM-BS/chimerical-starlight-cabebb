  {
    question: 'Will walls need to be opened up during the inspection?',
    answer: `No destructive work is normally required. We rely on calibrated moisture meters, humidity data, thermal imaging, and visual checks to trace the root cause. Where we need to see behind finishes we only use small borescope inspections with your permission.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      'Is this report valid for tenancy disputes and housing disrepair claims?',
    answer: `Yes. The report records readings, photographic evidence, and actionable recommendations that are routinely accepted by landlords, housing associations, and solicitors. We reference relevant standards so the findings can support case files when needed.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you check ventilation systems like extractor fans?',
    answer: `Absolutely. We test kitchen and bathroom extractors, assess trickle vents and passive airflow, and document the results in the report. You’ll receive practical advice on improving ventilation where upgrades or maintenance are required.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you recommend contractors for repairs?',
    answer: `We stay completely independent, so we don’t sell treatments or take referral fees. We do outline the type of contractor or specialist to contact and the questions to ask, leaving you free to choose who carries out any remedial work.`,
