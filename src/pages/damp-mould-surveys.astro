            <p>
              No destructive work is normally required. We rely on calibrated
              moisture meters, humidity data, thermal imaging, and visual checks to
              trace the root cause. Where we need to see behind finishes we only
              use small borescope inspections with your permission.

              claims?

              Yes. The report records readings, photographic evidence, and

            <summary>Do you check ventilation systems like extractor fans?</summary>
            <p>
              Absolutely. We test kitchen and bathroom extractors, assess trickle
              vents and passive airflow, and document the results in the report.
              You’ll receive practical advice on improving ventilation where
              upgrades or maintenance are required.

            <summary>Do you recommend contractors for repairs?</summary>
            <p>
              We stay completely independent, so we don’t sell treatments or take
              referral fees. We do outline the type of contractor or specialist to
              contact and the questions to ask, leaving you free to choose who
              carries out any remedial work.
