      <h2>Common Issues Identified</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rising Damp:</strong> Moisture tracking from the ground up
          through walls, potentially damaging finishes and structural timbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Penetrating Damp:</strong> Water ingress through roofs,
          walls, windows, or defective flashings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Condensation &amp; Mould:</strong> Unhealthy mould growth and
          condensation due to poor ventilation or insulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Woodworm Infestation:</strong> Insect activity in timbers that
          can weaken structural elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wet &amp; Dry Rot:</strong> Fungal decay affecting wood,
          causing serious structural weakness if left untreated.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every property is different. We tailor the investigation to the age of
        the building, the construction method, and the symptoms you are seeing so
        that the root cause—not just the visible damage—is identified.
      </p>
      <h2>How Our Damp &amp; Timber Surveys Work</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Preparation:</strong> Before the visit we review plans,
          historic repairs and your photographs to understand likely moisture
          pathways or timber vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-site inspection:</strong> Moisture meters, hygrometers and
          borescopes help us map dampness and check hidden timber zones without
          unnecessary damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> We interpret the readings, ventilation
          provision and material condition to confirm the source of decay and the
          urgency of remedial work.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Where areas are inaccessible we explain the limitations and suggest how
        to gain access safely. We can also liaise with contractors on the day if
        floorboards or boxing-in need to be lifted.
      </p>
      <h2>What You Receive Afterwards</h2>
      <p>
        Reports include annotated photographs, moisture maps, timber condition
        commentary and a prioritised action plan. We set out immediate health and
        safety actions, medium-term maintenance tasks, and guidance for
        monitoring so you know what to tackle first.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need cost guidance or a scope of works for tendering we can add
        this for a transparent fee. Our independence means recommendations are
        free from sales pressure—ideal for homeowners, landlords and legal
        professionals who need impartial evidence.
      </p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Need specifics? These answers explain how our damp and timber surveys
          run in practice.</em>
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>What happens during a damp and timber survey?</summary>
        <p>
          We inspect the exterior envelope, internal finishes and accessible
          timbers, taking moisture and humidity readings as we go. Decay or
          infestation is mapped and photographed so you know exactly where issues
          are located.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you carry out invasive testing?</summary>
        <p>
          Most surveys are non-destructive, using calibrated meters and
          borescopes. If we feel localised opening up is necessary we will agree
          the approach with you first and can supervise contractors so disruption
          is minimised.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Will the report satisfy lenders or solicitors?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Reports are written to RICS guidance with clear evidence, cause
          analysis and recommended remedial actions. They are regularly submitted
          to mortgage lenders, conveyancers and housing associations.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can you revisit to confirm repairs?</summary>
        <p>
          We can return after remedial works to verify moisture reduction or
          check timber treatments. Follow-up visits are quoted separately so you
          only pay for the support you need.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How quickly will I receive the report?</summary>
        <p>
          Turnaround is typically three to five working days. If you have tight
          deadlines we can deliver a same-day phone summary covering any high-risk
          defects.
