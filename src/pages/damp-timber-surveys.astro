      </p>

      <h2 id="timber-and-damp">Timber and Damp Investigation</h2>

        paths or long-term damp problems that need an evidence pack.
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Independent advice with no ties to treatment contractors or sales.</li>

        Targeted assessment for suspected leaks, rising damp or penetrating damp
        where you need clarity on cause and remediation steps.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moisture mapping to confirm the source and extent of damp patches.</li>
        <li>Clear remedial steps tailored to property construction and occupancy.</li>
        <li>Useful for homebuyers, landlords and warranty claims needing evidence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="damp-and-mould">Damp and Mould Survey</h2>
      <p>
        Ideal for condensation, humidity and indoor air-quality concerns affecting
        occupants or compliance obligations.

      <ul>

        <li>Health-focused recommendations for occupants and property managers.</li>
        <li>Ongoing monitoring guidance and optional post-remedial verification.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common issues we diagnose</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Rising damp:</strong> Moisture tracking from the ground up through
          walls, damaging finishes and embedded timbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Penetrating damp:</strong> Water ingress through roofs, walls,
          windows or defective flashings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Condensation &amp; mould:</strong> Unhealthy mould growth and
          condensation due to poor ventilation or insulation balance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timber decay &amp; infestation:</strong> Wet rot, dry rot or
          insect activity in structural and joinery timbers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Every property is different. We tailor the investigation to the age of the
        building, construction method and occupancy so the root cause—not just the
        visible damage—is identified.
      </p>

      <h2>How our specialist damp surveys work</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Preparation:</strong> Before the visit we review plans, historic
          repairs and your photographs to understand likely moisture pathways or
          timber vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-site inspection:</strong> Moisture meters, hygrometers and
          borescopes help us map dampness and check hidden zones without
          unnecessary damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> We interpret readings, ventilation provision
          and material condition to confirm the source of decay and the urgency of
          remedial work.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Where areas are inaccessible we explain limitations and suggest how to gain
        access safely. We can liaise with contractors on the day if floorboards or
        boxing-in need to be lifted.
      </p>

      <h2>What you receive afterwards</h2>
      <p>
        Reports include annotated photographs, moisture maps, timber condition
        commentary and a prioritised action plan. We set out immediate health and
        safety actions, medium-term maintenance tasks and monitoring guidance so you
        know what to tackle first.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need cost guidance or a scope of works for tendering we can add this
        for a transparent fee. Our independence means recommendations are free from
        sales pressure—ideal for homeowners, landlords and legal professionals who
        need impartial evidence.
      </p>

      <details>
        <summary>Which damp service should I choose?</summary>
        <p>
          Select the Timber and Damp Investigation when structural timber or hidden
          decay is suspected, the Damp Survey for localised leaks or rising damp,
          and the Damp and Mould Survey when condensation, humidity or health

      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What happens during a specialist damp survey?</summary>
        <p>
          We inspect the exterior envelope, internal finishes and accessible timber
          zones, taking calibrated moisture and humidity readings alongside a
          ventilation review. Evidence is photographed and referenced throughout the
          report.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you carry out invasive testing?</summary>
        <p>
          Most surveys are non-destructive, using calibrated meters and borescopes.
          If localised opening up is necessary we agree the approach with you first
          and can supervise contractors so disruption is minimised.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Will the report satisfy lenders or solicitors?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Reports follow RICS guidance, include evidence and clearly state the
          source of defects alongside recommended remedial actions. They are
          regularly accepted by mortgage lenders, solicitors and housing providers.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can you revisit to confirm repairs?</summary>
        <p>
          We can return after remedial works to re-test moisture levels or check
          timber treatment. Follow-up visits are quoted separately so you only pay
          for the time you need.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How quickly will I receive the report?</summary>
        <p>
          Turnaround is typically three to five working days. If urgent
          negotiations are underway we provide a same-day summary call highlighting
          any high-risk defects.
