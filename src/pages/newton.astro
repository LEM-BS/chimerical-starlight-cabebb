  "Newton is one of Chester’s classic family neighbourhoods—mainly inter-war and post-war semis, detached homes, and some older terraces close to Hoole and Brook Lane. Large gardens, quiet streets and proximity to schools make it a top choice for upsizers, but past alterations and variable build quality mean thorough surveys are essential. Common issues include historic movement (especially near the railway), past extensions without paperwork, and patchy insulation upgrades.",
  "Many homes in Newton have been modernised or extended, with open-plan kitchens, garage conversions, and lofts. Our focus is on the quality, compliance and longevity of these alterations. We also check for roof leaks, drainage changes, and evidence of damp—especially where previous work has changed the original structure.",
  "Our reports cut through estate agent jargon, highlight priority issues, and explain practical next steps for negotiation or maintenance. Whether you’re buying, remodelling or planning to stay long-term, you get honest, actionable advice specific to Newton’s housing stock.",
  'Need clarity on which survey fits local properties? Explore our <a href="/level-2">RICS Level 2 Home Survey</a>, see when a <a href="/level-3">Level 3 Building Survey</a> is the best option, and request targeted <a href="/damp-timber-surveys">damp & timber investigations</a> if moisture is a concern.',
