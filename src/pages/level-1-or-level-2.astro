  <h1>Do I Need a Level 1 or Level 2 Survey?</h1>
  <p><strong>Helping You Choose the Right Survey for Peace of Mind</strong></p>
  <p>If you're buying a modern property and want to understand its condition before committing, you may be wondering whether a <strong>Level 1 Condition Report</strong> or a <strong>Level 2 HomeBuyer Report</strong> is more suitable.</p>
  <p>At LEM Building Surveying Ltd, we guide clients across Chester, Wrexham, Flintshire and beyond in choosing the right survey—based on their needs, budget, and the property's condition.</p>
  <h2>What Is a Level 1 Condition Report?</h2>
  <p>A Level 1 survey is the most basic RICS survey available. It provides:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A visual inspection of the property's main elements</li>
  <li>Traffic light ratings for condition (green, amber, red)</li>
  <li>Identification of urgent or significant issues</li>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> No advice on repairs or ongoing maintenance</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>New-builds or nearly new properties</li>
  <li>Homes with no visible defects</li>
  <li>Buyers who just want a general snapshot before proceeding</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What Is a Level 2 HomeBuyer Report?</h2>
  <p>A Level 2 survey is the most commonly chosen report for conventional homes. It includes everything in Level 1, plus:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Commentary on the condition of key building elements</li>
  <li>Notes on repairs, risks, and potential hidden defects</li>
  <li>Advice on maintenance and next steps</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Best For:</strong></p>
  <ul>
  <li>Properties built after 1900</li>
  <li>Homes that appear in decent condition but haven’t been recently renovated</li>
  <li>Buyers who want a clearer understanding of the building’s performance</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Still Not Sure? Here's a Quick Guide:</h2>
  <p>If you need help choosing the right survey, we’re always happy to advise. There’s no pressure or obligation—just clear, honest insight from a qualified professional.</p>
  <h2>How to Choose the Right Survey Level</h2>
  <p>
        Each survey level is designed for different property types and levels of risk. If you start with a Level 1 survey and discover emerging defects, we can upgrade you to a Level 2 or Level 3 inspection so that your investment is fully protected.
      </p>
  <p>
        For complex or high-value properties, especially those with shared boundaries or extensions, commissioning the correct survey level early can save time and money.
