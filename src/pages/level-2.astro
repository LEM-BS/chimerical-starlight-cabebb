      <h1>RICS Level 2 HomeBuyer Report</h1>
      <p>
        Clear, practical advice from a RICS Level 2 HomeBuyer Report (homebuyer
        survey)—ideal for buyers who want peace of mind and negotiation power.

      <h2>Who It’s For &amp; Why It’s Popular</h2>
      <p>
        The Level 2 HomeBuyer Report is designed for traditionally constructed
        homes that appear in a serviceable condition. Think post-war houses with
        cavity walls, modern bungalows, or well-managed flats. If a property has
        been heavily altered, is obviously neglected, or sits in the countryside
        with unusual materials, we will recommend upgrading to a Level 3 building
        survey instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buyers value Level 2 surveys because they strike a balance between depth
        and efficiency. You still receive tailored repair advice, but without the
        extra cost associated with a full structural report. The document follows
        the RICS traffic-light system, making it easy to see what needs attention
        immediately and what can wait.
      </p>
      <h2>What’s Included in the Report</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Inspection of structure, roof, walls, floors, windows, services and
          outbuildings (visual only)
        </li>
        <li>Identification of significant defects and maintenance risks</li>
        <li>Advice on repairs and prioritised maintenance</li>
        <li>Health &amp; safety concerns and damp observations</li>
        <li>
          High-resolution photography so you can reference issues with sellers
          and contractors
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Moisture readings and thermal imaging spot-checks are included where
        required, giving context to visible staining or cold areas. The survey is
        non-invasive and does not include cost schedules, valuation, or
        reinstatement figures unless requested in advance.
      </p>
      <h2>How the Level 2 Survey Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Pre-survey review:</strong> We review estate agent details,
          planning history and your concerns so the inspection is focused.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-site inspection:</strong> Expect two to three hours on site
          for a typical three-bed home, checking the exterior, interior, roof
          space and accessible services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear reporting:</strong> You receive a digital report with
          repair priorities, maintenance advice and photographs, usually within
          three to five working days.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        During the visit we also note any legal matters—such as rights of way or
        potential boundary issues—that your conveyancer should verify. If access
        to any room or roof space is restricted we make this clear, so you can
        revisit it before exchange.
      </p>
      <h2>What Happens After the Report?</h2>
      <p>
        Every survey includes an explanation call. We will walk through the
        findings, suggest practical next steps, and help you prioritise repairs
        based on your budget or timescales. Where specialist contractors are
        needed we outline the skills to look for, keeping you firmly in control
        of who you instruct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many clients share the report with tradespeople or insurers. We are happy
        to provide clarification letters or speak directly with your solicitor if
        a defect is influencing negotiations. Our goal is to give you confidence
        to proceed, renegotiate, or walk away with minimal stress.
      </p>

          common queries we receive from buyers:</em>
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>What does a Level 2 HomeBuyer Report include?</summary>
        <p>
          This Level 2 homebuyer survey covers the major elements of the
          property. We assess the structure, roof coverings, joinery, services
          and damp risks, then explain which issues need immediate action and
          which are routine maintenance. Photographs and moisture readings are
          included to give you evidence for negotiations.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Which properties are suitable for a Level 2 survey?</summary>
        <p>
          Level 2 surveys best suit standard construction homes—typically post-
          1930s properties built from brick or block with pitched roofs. If the
          building is very old, substantially extended or clearly neglected we
          will advise upgrading to a Level 3 building survey for more intrusive
          investigation.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Does the Level 2 survey include a valuation or reinstatement figure?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Valuations and insurance reinstatement figures are not part of the
          standard Level 2 package, and we do not provide them. You will need to
          request these from a suitably qualified valuation professional if
          required.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How long will the inspection and report take?</summary>
        <p>
          A typical inspection lasts two to three hours, though larger homes may
          take longer. Reports are issued within three to five working days, and
          we let you know immediately if unforeseen access issues cause any
          delays.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I speak to the surveyor after receiving the report?</summary>
        <p>
          Absolutely. A follow-up call is included with every survey, giving you
          time to ask questions, weigh up repairs and plan negotiations. We can
          also provide written clarifications for your conveyancer if required.
