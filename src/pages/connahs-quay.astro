  'Connah’s Quay sits on the Dee Estuary and blends long-established streets with waterside regeneration. When clients invite us into properties on Wepre Drive, Bryn Road or the newer Deeside developments, they want straight-talking insight before committing to a purchase or major works. Because LEM Building Surveying Ltd is headquartered in the town, we recognise how salt-laden air, concrete framed extensions and an industrious past influence building performance. Our job is to turn that local knowledge into dependable advice that fits your budget, time frame and appetite for maintenance.',
  'Many of the homes we inspect were built during the post-war boom, when rapid expansion produced variations in cavity wall construction, damp-proofing and heating systems. Others are terraced cottages close to the docks or self-builds tucked behind the high street. Each style presents different considerations, from uneven floor slabs and repointed brickwork to loft conversions where permissions need to be checked. We tailor every inspection to the age, alterations and materials we find on site so that you understand the true condition before you sign contracts.',
  'Our clients span first-time buyers moving from across Flintshire, landlords refreshing rental portfolios and families preparing to invest in upgrades. They value accessible language, timely reporting and the opportunity to discuss recommendations directly with their surveyor. We keep communication personal and responsive, arranging surveys around your commitments and providing realistic next steps rather than generic checklists. The result is a report you can rely on when negotiating price, prioritising repairs or planning improvements.'

    'Wepre Park’s hillside streets typically feature split-level designs and retaining walls that need to be checked for movement and drainage routes. Along the river you will find 1960s and 1970s estates where cavity wall insulation and replacement windows have been retrofitted with varying success. We examine detailing around lintels, sills and parapets to ensure rainwater is managed effectively in exposed locations.',
    'In streets close to the industrial estate we regularly encounter reinforced concrete outbuildings, extended garages and mixed roofing materials. Slab levels, drainage falls and the condition of flat roofs are closely inspected because even small defects can channel water towards neighbouring properties. We also verify service routes and meter access where properties have been expanded in stages.',
    'Energy efficiency is a common priority. Older terraced homes may still rely on solid walls and suspended timber floors while newer houses have been upgraded with solar panels or air-source heat pumps. We report on insulation, ventilation pathways and achievable improvements so you can plan realistic retrofit steps without risking condensation or compromising the building fabric.',

      'We are often asked to review previous damp proofing, cavity wall extractions and insulation upgrades.
