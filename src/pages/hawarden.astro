  'Hawarden’s tree-lined streets and historic core make it a popular place to settle, whether you are upsizing within Flintshire or relocating from Chester. From the sandstone cottages clustered near St Deiniol’s Church to larger family homes off The Highway, each property comes with its own quirks. As a local surveying practice we blend regional building knowledge with national RICS standards so that your report reflects the realities of maintaining and adapting Hawarden homes.',
  'Much of the village sits within a conservation area, meaning sympathetic repairs and extensions are essential. We regularly inspect Victorian villas with slate roofs, coach houses converted into offices, and inter-war semis that have been modernised piecemeal. Understanding how earlier alterations were executed—particularly with drainage, damp proofing and roof structures—helps us explain ongoing risks before you exchange contracts.',
  'We also work with the thriving commuter communities around Ewloe, Broughton and St David’s Park where newer estates mix with custom self-builds. Purchasers often juggle busy careers with home moves and need prompt, direct advice. Our reports cut through jargon, highlight priority actions and outline practical steps so you can keep negotiations and renovation plans on track.',
