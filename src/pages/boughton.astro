  "Boughton, stretching along Chester’s eastern riverbank and canal, is home to an eclectic mix: Georgian and Victorian terraces, riverside cottages, converted warehouses, and modern apartments. Many properties are within conservation areas or subject to flood risk, meaning buyers need a careful survey to avoid costly surprises. We bring a local, practical approach—highlighting heritage restrictions, moisture risks, and the realities of maintaining riverside homes.",
  "Flooding and damp are real concerns for lower Boughton, while older terraces higher up the hill may show movement, cellar moisture, and signs of historic repair. Canal-side homes, especially converted warehouses, come with their own quirks—cladding, fire safety, and non-standard construction details. Our surveys identify what’s urgent, what’s ongoing, and what’s likely to crop up after you move in.",
