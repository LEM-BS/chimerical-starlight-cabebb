  "Chester city centre is defined by its rich architectural heritage—medieval timber-framed houses, Georgian terraces, Victorian conversions and the unique two-tier Rows. Many properties are listed or lie within strict conservation areas, meaning buyers and owners must be extra cautious about previous alterations, repair methods, and maintenance challenges. Our surveys are tailored to this historic core, combining national RICS standards with hands-on local experience and practical advice.",
  "From converted shops and apartments above the Rows, to mews houses tucked behind Watergate Street, every property poses unique risks. Cellars and undercrofts are prone to persistent damp; original timber frames require careful inspection for decay and beetle; and traditional brick or stonework may conceal older structural movement. We focus on highlighting not just defects, but the impact of listed status, planning controls, and local building practices.",
  "We work with both first-time buyers and seasoned investors who need clear, jargon-free guidance before committing to a city centre property. Our reports highlight what needs urgent attention, what’s cosmetic, and what’s realistically negotiable—so you can act with confidence.",

Damp in basements and undercrofts is a major issue, as is decay in exposed timber and roof structures.",

City centre properties may also have limited access for maintenance, which can drive up repair costs or restrict contractor choice.",
