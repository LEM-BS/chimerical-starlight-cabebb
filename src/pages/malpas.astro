  "Malpas sits at the heart of rural south-west Cheshire—known for its historic High Street, red-brick cottages, period townhouses, and modern homes on the edges of the village. Outlying hamlets and farms bring barn conversions, listed buildings, and unique rural challenges: private drainage, boundary quirks, and historic movement. Flood risk is low, but older properties may have damp or timber decay, especially around cellars and original ground floors.",
  "Our surveys are honest, practical, and focused on the realities of rural property—highlighting essential repairs, compliance issues and sensible priorities. Whether you’re relocating for village life or investing in a character home, we deliver advice grounded in local knowledge and RICS standards.",
  "We support buyers, owners and landlords in Malpas and surrounding villages, offering ongoing support long after the report is delivered.",
