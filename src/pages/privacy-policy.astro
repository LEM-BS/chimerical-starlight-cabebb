    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 16 May 2025</p>

    <p>
      LEM Building Surveying Ltd ("we", "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of
      everyone who contacts us about surveys, reports or related services. This policy
      explains what personal data we collect, how it is used and the rights available to
      you under UK data protection law.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      LEM Building Surveying Ltd is registered in the United Kingdom. Our principal place of
      business is Connah’s Quay, Deeside, Flintshire, CH5. You can contact the data
      controller by emailing
      <a href="mailto:enquiries@lembuildingsurveying.co.uk">enquiries@lembuildingsurveying.co.uk</a>
      or calling <a href="tel:07378732037">07378&nbsp;732&nbsp;037</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>We only collect personal data that helps us deliver our services effectively.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Enquiry information:</strong> Name, email, telephone number and property
        details supplied via our quote form, contact form or direct email.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Survey records:</strong> Notes, photographs and reports created while carrying
        out professional inspections for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Website usage data:</strong> Anonymised analytics data (page views, referring
        sites and device type) collected via Google Analytics to improve our site.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment information:</strong> We only store the information required on invoices
        and bank transfers—card details are never collected via this site.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Personal data is used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing quotations and answering your questions about our services.</li>
      <li>Delivering surveys, reports and supporting documentation.</li>
      <li>
        Maintaining internal records for taxation and professional compliance with RICS and
        RPSA membership requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitoring website performance to ensure users can easily access key information and
        forms.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal Basis</h2>
    <p>
      The legal grounds we rely on are consent (when you submit your information to us),
      contract (when we are engaged to provide services) and legitimate interest (for site
      analytics and protecting our business).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Who We Share Your Data With</h2>
    <p>
      We treat your data confidentially. It may be shared with trusted partners only when
      necessary:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Google Analytics – for anonymised website statistics.</li>
      <li>Accountancy software – to manage invoicing and bookkeeping.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell your data and we never pass it to contractors for marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Enquiry emails and form submissions are kept for up to 24 months so that we can answer
      follow-up questions. Survey reports and project files are retained for at least six
      years to meet regulatory and insurance obligations.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
