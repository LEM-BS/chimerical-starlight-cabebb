  'Handbridge blends riverside terraces, Victorian villas and sensitive infill developments right on the edge of Chester city centre. Many homes combine period detailing with modernised interiors—loft conversions, open-plan ground floors and reworked gardens are commonplace. Buyers need reassurance that these alterations are structurally sound, appropriately approved and suitable for life beside the Dee.',
  'Properties near the river and Meadows face higher damp and flood vigilance, while sandstone retaining walls and shared drainage add to the checks we complete. Cellars, basements and narrow terraces often reveal ventilation gaps or long-term moisture concerns. We bring local building knowledge together with national RICS standards so you receive a report rooted in Handbridge realities.',
