  'Queen’s Park stands out as one of Chester’s most desirable addresses—handsome Victorian and Edwardian houses, wide avenues, and elevated views over the Dee. Properties here often combine period grandeur with significant alteration: converted lofts, basement rooms, and open-plan extensions are common. With prestige comes complexity—buyers need a survey that addresses roof leaks, damp, roof structure, period joinery, and evidence of historic movement or settlement.',
  'Many Queen’s Park homes are listed or within conservation areas, so unauthorised works, non-traditional materials and missing approvals can all cause headaches for buyers. Mature trees, old drains and boundary walls are other sources of risk. Our surveys blend technical rigour with a focus on what matters most for owners of these statement properties.',
  'We provide clear, actionable reports and ongoing advice—helping buyers and owners maintain both the fabric and the value of their home.',
  'Need clarity on which survey fits local properties? Explore our <a href="/level-2">RICS Level 2 Home Survey</a>, see when a <a href="/level-3">Level 3 Building Survey</a> is the best option, and request targeted <a href="/damp-timber-surveys">damp & timber investigations</a> if moisture is a concern.',
