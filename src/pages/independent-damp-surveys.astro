          <p>
            Damp issues can wreak havoc on properties, leading to costly repairs

            Unlike surveys tied to repair companies, independent damp surveys
            ensure objectivity; they focus solely on assessing the property's

            misdiagnosis. Homeowners can save money and avoid future headaches.
            Independent damp surveyors use specialised tools to detect issues
            not visible to the naked eye.

          <h2>Common Signs of Damp and Timber Issues</h2>
          <p>
            Identifying damp and timber issues early can prevent extensive
            damage. Common indicators include a musty odour, visible mould, or
            peeling wallpaper. You may also notice discoloured patches on walls,
            signalling moisture issues. Timber issues may cause wood to feel
            soft or appear decayed.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Stains or patches on ceilings and walls</li>
            <li>Bubbling or peeling paint</li>
            <li>Mould growth around windows</li>

          <h2>When Should You Book an Independent Damp Survey?</h2>
          <p>
            Timing is essential when it comes to damp surveys. Ideally, book a
            survey if you notice any signs of dampness or before buying a
            property. Consider booking a survey:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When buying or selling a property</li>
            <li>If damp patches or mould appear</li>
            <li>After a flood or heavy rainfall</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These surveys are also crucial for older properties, as they are
            more susceptible to hidden issues. Acting swiftly ensures your
            property remains in optimal condition.

            highlights the extent and severity of identified issues. Typically,
            a damp survey report may contain:

          <ul>
            <li>Detailed moisture readings</li>
            <li>Identified sources of moisture</li>
