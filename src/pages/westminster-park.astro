  'Westminster Park is renowned for its leafy streets, spacious detached and semi-detached houses, and generous gardens—making it a favourite with families and upsizers. Most properties date from the 1930s to the 1970s, though there’s a growing number of newer builds and extended houses. Typical issues include ground movement, drainage challenges, and the impact of mature trees and large plots. Many homes have seen garage conversions, rear extensions, and loft remodels—standards and compliance can vary.',
  'Flat roofs, boundary movement, and patchy insulation upgrades are also common. We routinely see issues with damp proof courses, tree root impact, and surface water drainage after landscaping or extension work. Our surveys are tailored to the realities of Westminster Park’s housing—cutting through estate agent gloss to highlight genuine priorities.',
  'Reports are designed to support buyers, movers and home improvers—explaining urgent repairs, regulatory risks, and the practical realities of upkeep for larger homes and gardens.',
  'Need clarity on which survey fits local properties? Explore our <a href="/level-2">RICS Level 2 Home Survey</a>, see when a <a href="/level-3">Level 3 Building Survey</a> is the best option, and request targeted <a href="/damp-timber-surveys">Timber and Damp Investigation, Damp Survey or Damp and Mould Survey services</a> if moisture is a concern.',
