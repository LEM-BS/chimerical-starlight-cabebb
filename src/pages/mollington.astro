  'Mollington combines rural village charm with Chester’s city convenience—mixing period cottages, barn conversions, executive homes, and new builds on country plots. Properties here often have private drainage, varied construction, and outbuildings or land. Buyers need to be aware of risks specific to rural settings: soakaways, septic tanks, off-mains services, boundary issues, and historic movement due to mixed ground types.',
  'Older houses may have solid brick, sandstone or timber frames, original joinery and uninsulated walls. Newer builds may still have snagging, settlement, or unfinished landscaping. Extensions, remodelling and outbuildings are common, so paperwork and build quality can vary. Our surveys are detailed and locally focused—addressing both the charm and the challenges of village property.',
  'We help buyers, families relocating for space, and upsizers making the move from Chester proper—offering realistic, plain-English reports and ongoing advice.',
  'Need clarity on which survey fits local properties? Explore our <a href="/level-2">RICS Level 2 Home Survey</a>, see when a <a href="/level-3">Level 3 Building Survey</a> is the best option, and request targeted <a href="/damp-timber-surveys">Timber and Damp Investigation, Damp Survey or Damp and Mould Survey services</a> if moisture is a concern.',
