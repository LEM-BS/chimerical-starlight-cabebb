      <p>
        Expert airflow testing and ventilation reviews across Flintshire,
        Chester, Cheshire &amp; the North West — ideal for landlords, homebuyers,
        and post-renovation checks.

    <div class="box-container">
      <h2>Practical Ventilation Surveys for Homes</h2>
      <p>
        Our independent residential ventilation assessments focus on practical
        compliance with Building Regulations Approved Document F. We test and
        report on extraction and airflow performance to help you identify
        under-ventilation, reduce mould risks, and ensure a healthy indoor
        environment.
      </p>
      <h3>What’s Included</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visual inspection of ventilation points, including fans, trickle vents
          and passive inlets
        </li>
        <li>Airflow measurement using funnel anemometer equipment</li>
        <li>
          Benchmarking results against <strong>Approved Document F</strong>
          recommendations
        </li>
        <li>Photographic evidence, room-by-room results, and clear reporting</li>
        <li>
          Advice on remedial options or upgrades where underperformance is found
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>When to Book a Ventilation Assessment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>After installing or upgrading extract fans or insulation</li>
        <li>Before letting or selling your property</li>
        <li>If you're experiencing condensation, persistent mould, or high humidity</li>
        <li>Following retrofits or renovations</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How We Test &amp; Analyse Airflow</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Set-up:</strong> We log humidity and temperature readings to
          understand background conditions before testing each extract point.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testing:</strong> Calibrated funnel anemometers measure airflow
          volumes, while smoke pencils highlight dead spots or back-draughts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Results are compared with Approved
          Document F targets and the property’s occupancy patterns to determine
          where improvements are necessary.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Where safe access allows, we inspect loft ducting, roof terminals and
        trickle vents to identify blockages or poor installations. You’ll know
        whether issues stem from fan performance, duct layout, or everyday usage
        habits.
      </p>
      <h2>Reporting &amp; Ongoing Support</h2>
      <p>
        You receive a concise summary within 24 hours followed by a detailed
        report. This includes colour-coded airflow tables, photographs, and
        tailored recommendations. We outline quick wins such as cleaning grilles
        or adjusting settings, alongside longer-term upgrades like continuous
        running fans or heat-recovery systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Need to evidence compliance for letting agents or contractors? We can
        provide follow-up letters or revisit after remedial works to verify that
        improvements have achieved the desired airflow rates.
      </p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Curious about the process? These FAQs cover what clients usually ask
          before booking.</em>
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>What equipment do you use during a ventilation assessment?</summary>
        <p>
          We arrive with calibrated funnel anemometers, hygrometers and data
          loggers to capture airflow volumes and environmental conditions. The
          results are documented room-by-room with supporting photographs.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Will the visit disrupt my tenants or household?</summary>
        <p>
          Disruption is minimal. Each room takes only a few minutes to test and
          we work around occupants wherever possible. Access is needed to fans,
          trickle vents and any loft hatches.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Does the assessment provide Building Control sign-off?</summary>
        <p>
          The survey is advisory and does not replace Building Control
          certification. It does give you evidence of airflow performance and a
          clear action plan to achieve compliance if required.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can you recommend improvements if airflow is poor?</summary>
        <p>
          Absolutely. We suggest suitable upgrades, from boost controls to new
          continuous running fans, and highlight maintenance tasks to keep
          systems operating efficiently.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How quickly will I receive the results?</summary>
        <p>
          You receive an initial summary within 24 hours, with the full report
          delivered in three to four working days. Urgent risks are flagged by
          phone straight away.
