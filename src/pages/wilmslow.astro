  "Wilmslow brings together late Victorian villas, 1920s and 1930s family homes, modern gated developments and riverside apartments along the Bollin. Each neighbourhood has its own quirks—from historic sandstone cellars in the town centre to timber-framed barns converted near Lindow Common.",
  "Extensions, loft conversions and open-plan reconfigurations are commonplace, making it important to understand how older structures interact with modern materials. Properties close to the River Bollin or Lindow Moss require careful consideration of drainage, ground conditions and potential flood impacts.",
  "LEM supports Wilmslow clients with balanced, independent advice. We combine practical building pathology, local planning knowledge and cost awareness so you can negotiate, maintain and improve your property with confidence.",
  'Need clarity on which survey fits local properties? Explore our <a href="/level-2">RICS Level 2 Home Survey</a>, see when a <a href="/level-3">Level 3 Building Survey</a> is the best option, and request targeted <a href="/damp-timber-surveys">Timber and Damp Investigation, Damp Survey or Damp and Mould Survey services</a> if moisture is a concern.',
